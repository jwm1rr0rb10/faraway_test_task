# Word of Window

## Test task for Server Engineer (Raman Zaitsau)

### 📜 Description
Design and implement “Word of Wisdom” TCP server.

• TCP server should be protected from DDoS attacks with Proof of Work (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), using a challenge-response protocol.

• The choice of the PoW algorithm should be explained.

• After Proof of Work verification, the server should send one of the quotes from the “Word of Wisdom” book or another collection of quotes.

• Docker files should be provided for both the server and the client that solves the PoW challenge.

### ✨ Features:

🔐 **PoW protection**: Prevents brute-force and bot-based DDoS attacks.

⚡ **SHA-256 based challenge**: Adjustable difficulty depending on server load.

📖 **Quote delivery**: Once PoW is verified, the server sends a quote from the "Word of Wisdom" collection.

🐳 **Docker support**: Dockerized setup for both server and client.

### 🛡️ Proof of Work (PoW) Algorithm Choice

When selecting a PoW algorithm, the main consideration is the type of attackers we aim to defend against. Typically, small hacker groups, competitors, or individual attackers cannot afford high-cost servers. Even if they do, they need to migrate quickly from one server to another, making an efficient and adaptable PoW crucial.

❓ **Why SHA-256?**

✔️ **Security & Performance**: Unlike SHA-1, which is outdated and insecure, SHA-256 offers strong cryptographic security.

✔️ **Avoiding Self-DDoS**: Algorithms like Scrypt and Argon2, while effective against bots, are too resource-intensive and could overload our own server.

✔️ **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**:

📈 Increased load → higher difficulty.

🚫 High requests from a single IP → adaptive difficulty increase.

❌ Persistent offenders → temporary IP ban (e.g., 24 hours).

### 🔥 Enhanced PoW System

#### 1. Sessions for Legitimate Users

• If an IP is not flagged for suspicious activity, then:

• After successfully solving one PoW challenge, they receive 15 minutes of free access.

• This reduces the computational burden on users.

• Sessions are stored in Redis.

#### 2. Dynamic PoW Difficulty

• PoW difficulty adjusts dynamically:

• Under normal traffic, users solve simple challenges (5-10 leading zeros).

• If an IP's activity increases, the difficulty scales up (15-30 leading zeros).

• If the server detects anomalously fast solutions, the IP is banned.

##### 3. Blacklist System

• IPs solving difficult challenges too quickly are added to a blacklist.

• No full blocking: these IPs receive the hardest PoW challenges (30-32 leading zeros), making an attack prohibitively expensive.

#### 4. State Tracking in Redis

• We use Redis to track user activity:

• Key: pow_session:<IP>

• Value: timestamp + last PoW difficulty

• If the session is active, no new PoW is required for 15 minutes.

• ### 🎯 Conclusion

✅ Legitimate users are not affected – 1 PoW every 15 minutes.

✅ Bots must solve PoW constantly, making an attack unprofitable.

✅ The system adapts flexibly to different loads.

• By implementing this system, we achieve a balance between security and usability! 🚀

### 📌 Future Enhancements

• Currently, only a basic PoW system has been implemented. The full adaptive PoW system, as described above, would require approximately one week to develop and integrate.



## 📂 Project Structure

### All the code is stored in two repositories:

• The first repository contains the client and server.
• The second repository holds all the libraries.
• The main library is located at: github.com/RRWM1rr0rB/faraway_lib/backend/golang/core/tcp.

## Architecture Choice

- **Client-Server**: A client-server architecture that separates logic between client and server code.

- **Layers**: Layers such as controller and policy interact through interfaces and structures. As the logic scales, this allows for efficient functional expansion. Additionally, a domain folder can be introduced for core logic, with a service handling interactions and database selection, while storage is responsible for implementing database interaction methods.
